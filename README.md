# Sillam√§e Invaders

This is a school project that I made using vanilla JavaScript, Html and CSS.

## Requirements for the game:
- Game runs at at least 60 FPS at all times
- No frame drops!
- Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
- It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!
- Pause menu, that includes:
- - Continue
- - Restart
- A score board that displays the following metrics:
- - Countdown clock or Timer that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running
- - Score that will display the current score (XP or points)
- - Lives that shows the number of lives that the player has left
- The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.
- Everything can be operated with keys.
